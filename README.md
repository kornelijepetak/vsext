# vsext
The Portal for all my Visual Studio extension repositories


#### [Horizon](https://github.com/kornelijepetak/vsext-horizon)
- Contains helper classes and extension methods that make VS Extension development a little bit easier
- This is heavily a work in progress so expect a lot of changes (some of which may be breaking - hopefully not too much)

#### [Joke of the day](https://github.com/kornelijepetak/vsext-jokeoftheday)
- Very simple extension that changes the `//joke` comment in the current line into a random joke
- Jokes are retrieved randomly from the [Internet Chuck Norris Database](http://www.icndb.com/api/)
- Created for DEMO for Visual Studio Extensibility presentation @ MS Community Dev User Group (Zagreb, Croatia)

#### [Vizz](https://github.com/kornelijepetak/vsext-vizz)
- Visualizer for the `List<T>` that shows a chart with values

#### [NumberTooLong](https://github.com/kornelijepetak/vsext-numbertoolong)
- A C# analyzer and a codefix that inserts decimal separators in lengthy numbers.
